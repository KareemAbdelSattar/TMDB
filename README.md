# TMDB: The Clean Architecture Movie App

Welcome to TMDB, a sophisticated Movies App meticulously designed using Clean Architecture and the powerful Combine framework. This application stands as a testament to best coding practices, offering a blend of functionality, scalability, and seamless user interaction.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Data Fetching:** Leverages an advanced network layer for efficient retrieval and parsing of movies data.
- **Intuitive UI:** Offers a streamlined interface showcasing a curated list of movies with seamless browsing capabilities.
- **Pagination Support:** Implements a smooth scrolling experience with pagination for effortless navigation through movie lists.
- **Detailed Movie Insights:** Facilitates user engagement by providing in-depth details of each movie.

## Architectural Excellence

- **Clean Architecture Model:** Adopts a layered approach (Domain, Data, Presentation) ensuring a decoupled and testable structure.
- **MVVM Pattern:** Utilizes the Model-View-ViewModel pattern in the presentation layer for a clear separation of concerns.
- **Combine Framework Integration:** Harnesses the power of Combine for responsive and event-driven programming.
- **Factory Package:** Implements the Factory package to enhance dependency injection, improving code maintainability and testability by providing a streamlined way to create and manage dependencies.
- **Robust Network Layer:** A well-architected network layer underpins API communication, enhancing data exchange efficiency.
- **Coordinator Pattern:** Consider implementing the Coordinator pattern for improved navigation if the application complexity grows.
- **Skeleton Loading:** Enhances the user experience with skeleton loading, providing an interactive loading experience that keeps users engaged while waiting for content to load.

## Future Roadmap

- **Secure Senstive Data:** Ensures the protection of sensitive information by leveraging CocoaPods-keys to encrypt critical data such as the API_KEY, safeguarding it from unauthorized access.
- **Offline Accessibility:** Aiming to introduce data persistence for enhanced offline capabilities.
- **Search Functionality:** Plans to enable movie search to refine user experience.
- **Progressive Pagination:** Intending to incorporate a bottom loading indicator for a more intuitive pagination experience.
